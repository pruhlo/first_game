# Game simulation as a console application

## How to play

The console application has two game modes:
1. Automatic - started by entering "1" in the console after the request

![example](https://github.com/pruhlo/first_game/blob/master/Screen.png)

2. Manual - starts by simply pressing the enter button

## How to start
Download the game.py file and open the terminal with the game in the directory and run:
```
python3 game.py
```

## Possible problems 
the script uses linux terminal color codes, so, it is possible that the progress of the game in Windows is not displayed correctly
