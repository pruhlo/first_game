# Game simulation as a console application

## How to play

The console application has two game modes:
<center>1. Automatic - starts by simply pressing the enter button</center>
![example](https://github.com/pruhlo/first_game/blob/master/Screen.png)
<center>2. Manual - started by entering "1" in the console after the request</center>

## How to start
Download the game.py file and open the terminal with the game in the directory and run:
'''
python3 game.py
'''

## Possible problems 
the script uses linux terminal color codes, so, it is possible that the progress of the game in Windows is not displayed correctly
