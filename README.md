# Game simulation as a console application



## How to play

The console application has two game modes:
<center>1. Automatic - starts by simply pressing the enter button</center>

<center>2. Manual - started by entering "1" in the console after the request</center>

## Possible problems 
the script uses linux terminal color codes, so, it is possible that the progress of the game in Windows is not displayed correctly
